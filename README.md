# models
Hello readers, 

Here is my repo where my financial models are avaible for review. I'm an investor, entrepreneur with training in the "value" school of investing. I've read many of Warren Buffett's books, writings and have read much more literature on investing from successful money managers of past and present. Financial modelling is an essential part of investing and business. Calculating an asset's income stream, its balance sheet, its cash flows and most importantly understanding its business model are important for making intelligent investments. In this repo I will upload all my models, the models I find valuable and other materials relevant to investing. 

Enjoy,
Alex
