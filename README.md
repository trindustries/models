# models
Hello Readers

I'll share models on public companies and other securities for the world to read and share. The goal is to build a collection of financial models I've written, each gettign more sophisticated with time and experience.

Here's a quick introduction on who I am: I'm an investor, entrepreneur with training in the "value" school of investing. I've read many of Warren Buffett's books, writings and have read much more literature on investing from successful money managers of past and present. Financial modelling is an essential part of investing and business. Calculating an asset's income stream, tracking its balance sheet, its cash flows and most importantly understanding its business model are important for making intelligent investments. In this repo I will upload all my models, the models I find valuable and other materials relevant to investing. 

Enjoy,
Alex
